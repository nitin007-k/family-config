    The **RoyaleAPI Clan Family** (RACF) was originally known as
    the Reddit Alpha Clan Family and then briefly as the 100 Thieves Clan Family.
    Home to professional players that eventually moved on to play at CRNAO,
    King’s Cup, and CRL, our family fosters an environment where casual
    and competitive styles of play can both flourish.
